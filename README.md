# A-star algorithm

Just an experimental work for knowing how this algorithm works.

Build
-----------
Build it use the Processing.
I use processing-3.5.4 in particular.

How to use
-----------
Mouse Left Press : draw obstacles
Mouse Right Press : erase obstacles
Mouse Wheel Press : view the g and h value at your mouse position.
Press r : reset

The number on the left-up corner is the calculation time in ms.

The path will be re-calculated when an obstacle appearing on the way only.
